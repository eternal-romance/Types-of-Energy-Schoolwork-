In summary, I made this website for a school project about the types of energy used around the world.
It took me just under 3 hours to complete everything.

The site was almost entirely built using TypeScript, so to host it, you’ll need to compile or convert the code beforehand.

Anyway, I made the source code public for anyone who wants to get inspired or even copy it to present to their teachers — I don’t really mind.
